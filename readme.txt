== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I upload the videos? =
There are three ways you add add a video

1. You can use the WordPress media manager and upload the videos there.
2. You can use [Flowplayer Drive](http://flowplayer.org/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=Flowplayer%20Plugin) to upload a video and let Flowplayer.org host you video.
3. You can store your videos on Amazon S3 or any other cloud host and add the links manually.

= What video format do I need? =
It is recommended to add at least two [video formats](http://flowplayer.org/docs/setup.html?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=Flowplayer%20Plugin#video-formats) so that the video plays on as many browsers as possible. By default Flowplayer attempts to use HTML5 video, and if it's not supported then Flash (9.0+) and MP4 is used. MP4 is enough for complete browser support, but providing WebM and/or OGG video gives you broader support for HTML5 video which is the preferred technology.

= Why use Flowplayer when there is video support since WordPress 3.6? =

Flowplayer HTML5 for WordPress provides a video management system where you can manage all of your video from a central place. You do not need to remember all of the shortcode configuration attributes, you can simply configure the videos form within the options. We are continuously adding further features to the plugin.

= Why can I not see the video that I just uploaded to Flowplayer Drive? =

It takes some time for the video to be processed. The plugin fetches the video links from Flowplayer.org and the results are cached. The cache is refreshed every 15 minutes.

= How do I load Flowplayer assets locally when using Flowplayer Commercial? =

If you want to load the Flowplayer assets (JS, CSS and SWF) for your site then you can download the files from [your account](https://flowplayer.org/account/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=Flowplayer%20Plugin). Create a new folder `flowplayer-commercial` in `wp-content`. Place the files in this new folder. The option in the settings to use Flowplayer CDN should be disabled

= How do I add Ads to my videos? =

After [Signing up](http://flowplayer.org/asf/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=Flowplayer%20Plugin) you will get your own custom advertising plugin that you upload and paste the link in the settings.

= How do I create a playlist? =

Edit the video you want to add to a playlist and there should be a playlist box. You can choose an existing playlist or create a new one there. You can add the playlist to a post via the "Add Video" button under the post title.

= How do I set multi-resolution videos? =

With Flowplayer HTML5 for WordPress v1.10.0 we have included [multi-resolution videos support](https://flowplayer.org/docs/drive.html#quality-selector-plugin?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=Flowplayer%20Plugin).

- The easy way is to use [Flowplayer Drive](http://flowplayer.org/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=Flowplayer%20Plugin) paid version where everything is done for you.

- The second way requires creating the multiple resolution files and naming them using the [predefined naming structure](https://flowplayer.org/docs/drive.html#quality-selector-plugin?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=Flowplayer%20Plugin). In the configuration tab you need to define the default video resolution and the other resolutions.

= Can I test the commercial version? =

Yes, we have some sample keys for the specific urls

`localhost  $289122895653393`
`127.0.0.1  $130388743137804`

= Flowplayer Drive issues? =

If you are unable to connect to the Flowplayer Drive API, make sure you are connected to the internet and that you are logged in. You can login in the Settings page.

= Flowplayer issues? =

If you are having a issue please check the [Flowplayer known issues page](http://flowplayer.org/docs/known-issues.html?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=Flowplayer%20Plugin).

= What happens when I disable the plugin? =

Nothing, other then it being disabled.

= What happens when I uninstall the plugin? =

Why would you want to do that? :-) If you do need to uninstall the plugin all of the data (Flowplayer videos and settings) will be deleted so that you do not have unnecessary data left on your database. Your media files will not be deleted. If you want to backup the Flowplayer videos that you have created you can easily export them under Tools -> Export -> Videos.
